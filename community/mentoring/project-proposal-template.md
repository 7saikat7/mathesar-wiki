This is the proposal template for applications to any mentorship programs that we participate in. All proposals **must** have all the sections in this template. You can add additional sections if desired.

We recommend creating a Google Doc that follows this structure and sharing it with the mentors. Please make sure that all mentors have commenting permissions.

> The template starts below this box. Instructions for each section are provided in infoboxes like this one.

# \<Project Title\>

## Project Synopsis

> Provide a one paragraph synopsis of the project and outcomes you are proposing in this section.
{.is-info}

## Project Plan

> The **Project Plan** section is for you to describe in detail what exactly you plan to do as part of this project. 
>
> Use the sub-sections provided below. You may add more if needed, but do not remove any sections.
{.is-info}

### Problem

> Describe your understanding of the problem you're solving and potential use cases that solving it would enable.
{.is-info}

### Proposed Solution
> Describe the details of your solution and demonstrate why your solution solves the problem. Provide as many technical details as possible with references to how your solution will fit into the current code, APIs, and UI.
>
> If your solution involves a new or updated user interface, include mockups.
>
> If your solution involves making a decision about external libraries to use, provide details about your choices and the reasons behind those choices. 
{.is-info}

### Research & References
> Include any research you've done or references that you've found related to your solution here.
{.is-info}

### Timeline & Deliverables
> Include a timeline of the deliverables you aim to accomplish each week. Add one row per week. Deliverables should be as specific as possible.
> 
> For example, “Complete API for cancelling orders” is a good deliverable. If you haven’t shipped the API for cancelling orders that week, you know you’re not on track.
>
> An example of a bad deliverable is “Work on code”. You will be working on code throughout your internship, so you cannot use this deliverable to know whether your plan is on track.
> 
> [The GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) should be helpful in determining dates.
