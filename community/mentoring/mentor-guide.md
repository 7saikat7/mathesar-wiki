Mentorship in a [mentoring program](/en/community/mentoring) is a serious commitment but a very rewarding experience. 

[The GSoC Mentor Guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/) provides a good overview of the mentorship process in general. The rest of this document assumes that you have read that guide and only covers Mathesar-specific processes and guidelines.

## Proposing a Project
Please use our [Project Idea Template](/en/community/mentoring/project-idea-template) to add new projects to the [Project Ideas](/en/community/mentoring/project-ideas) page. If you have doubts about whether your project idea is viable, discuss it on Matrix with other team members first before writing it down.

> The ["Defining a Project (Ideas List)" page of the GSoC mentor guide](https://google.github.io/gsocguides/mentor/defining-a-project-ideas-list) provides useful guidance on the kinds of ideas that make good projects.

## Application Period
Once the initial application period opens, things can get chaotic for a little bit as hundreds of applicants investigate various open source communities to try and contribute to them and find a good fit for an mentoring project. There are a lot of emails, chat messages, GitHub comments, and so on. This stage of the program is the most intense and lasts about a month (although the first few days are the most overwhelming).

Some tips:
- Be prepared for this ahead of time.
- Have a good, well-documented set of tasks suitable for first-time contributors that you can point people to. Create new ones as you think of them.
- Point people to public channels and away from email and DMs so that others can answer questions too.
- You may get a lot of low effort questions like "how do I get started". Respond by asking for more details rather than trying to guess what they mean. 
  - In general, the effort involved in helping someone should be proportional to the effort they put in to asking.
- If you find yourself answering the same questions often, update the relevant documentation so you can point people to it instead.

### Reviewing Applications
You should encourage applicants to share drafts of the application with you ahead of time. Using a Google Doc with comment permissions enabled is probably the easiest way to achieve collaboration. Reviews should be completed in 1-2 days if possible.

Focus on making sure that their understanding of the project, the project plan, timeline, and deliverables match what you had in mind and is feasible (keeping in mind that they are new to Mathesar and may not get things done as quickly as you would).

## Program Period

### Preparation
Before the program period begins, talk to your co-mentors ahead of your time to create a plan for how to collaborate – will one of you be the primary mentor or will all of you be equally involved? How will checkins and notes work?

### Post-Announcement
- Reach out to your mentee ASAP after the program acceptances are announced and welcome them to the project.
- Review the proposal again and ensure that the implementation details and weekly deliverables are feasible and well thought-out. There are probably some things that could be clarified or changed – work with the mentee to fix these items before any work is actually started.
- Have an introductory call with the mentee and get to know each other. Ask them questions about themselves and talk about yourself too.
- Set up regular meetings: 
  - a weekly video call for the mentors to check-in with the mentee
  - a monthly call with the Mathesar organization admin to check in with the mentee.
- Create a document to keep any project information and notes. This document should be shared with the program coordinators. This document should include:
  - the “final” implementation plan and weekly milestones (“final” because it is subject to change during the coding period based on progress)
  - the mentee’s contact information and emergency contact
  - all meeting notes
  - any other project-relevant information.
- Decide with the mentee on the workflow the project will follow. e.g.
  - Does the mentee understand regular git workflow (e.g. pull requests, branches, reviews)?
  - Does the mentee understand the code review process?
  - How often should code be committed?
  - How often should your mentee give you progress reports?
  - What is the best way for the mentee to get your attention when they are stuck?
- Help the mentee get their development environment set up if needed.
- Ensure that the mentee is added to our [Team Members](/en/team/members) and has the correct GitHub and wiki permissions.

### Day-to-Day
- Attend your weekly check-in.
  - Take good notes so that your backup mentor can pick up where you left off easily if you’re unavailable.
  - Make sure the mentee is on-track with their weekly milestones and if not, work with them to figure out why and come up with a plan.
  - Ask how the mentee is doing generally.
  - Praise things they are doing well and provide constructive criticism on the things they could improve on. Both of these are important.
- Review all work/code promptly. You should aim to review within 1 business day.
  - If your mentee is blocked on their work for some other reason, help them become unblocked as soon as possible.
- Check in on Matrix with the mentee once every day or two. Remember that they are often not experienced with the work they are doing and may not know to ask for help or may be stuck on something that they cannot articulate very well.
- Ask for feedback on your mentorship every few weeks.
- It may be useful to find an opportunity to invite your mentee to present their work at a CCI research meeting. It is up to you when you’d like to do this.
- Make sure you're familiar with the program timeline and submit your required evaluations on time.
- Talk to the program coordinator proactively. Especially if:
  - your mentee is not active and engaged regularly.
  - your mentee is not communicating enough or misses a check-in.
  - you have concerns or even just a bad feeling about something.
  - you have feedback or questions about any part of the program process.
  - you'd like feedback about how your mentoring is going
