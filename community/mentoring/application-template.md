### The Solution

>
> If your solution involves a new or updated user interface, include mockups.

### Timeline & Deliverables
> Include a timeline of what external deliverables you aim to accomplish each week.
> 
> For example, “Complete API for cancelling orders” is a good external deliverable. If you haven’t shipped the API for cancelling orders that week, you know you’re not on track.
>
> An example of a bad deliverable is “Work on code”. You will be working on code throughout your internship, so you cannot use this deliverable to know whether your plan is on track.
> 
> [The GSoC timeline](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/timeline) may be helpful.
