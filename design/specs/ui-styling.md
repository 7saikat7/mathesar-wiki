# Context
Mathesar's user interface design encompasses the aesthetic, responsiveness, efficiency, and accessibility of its visual elements and interactions. Essentially what the user sees when they interact with the product.

# General Guidelines
## Fonts
Mathesar's user interface should incorporate a readable sans-serif font that is optimized for web and mobile interfaces.

### Scale
On a typographic scale, the distance between the smallest and largest font size should be minimal and just enough to create contrast and hierarchy between content. 

### Contrast

## Colors

### Themes

### Palette



## Icons

### Library vs. Custom

## Interactions

### Menus
### Buttons
### Table Actions
