> Mathesar is a work in progress and will be ready for early adopters in mid-2022.
{.is-warning}

Mathesar is am open source tool that provides an intuitive user interface to databases. Our aim is to make it easy for non-technical users to be able to work with databases without prior knowledge of database concepts. We're heavily inspired by the user experience of [Dabble DB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVj5RZOqwY).

Users can either set up a database from scratch or connect to an existing database. They can store, organize, and set up various views of their data. By our beta release, users will also be able to collaborate with other users, see visualizations of their data, and evolve their data model as their needs change.

Mathesar is designed to be self-hosted on your own server.

## Use cases
Mathesar can be used to:
- Publish or explore public datasets
- Run business processes such as:
  - inventory management
  - event planning
  - project and task management
  - expense tracking and accounting
  - customer relationship management
- Provide non-technical users access to existing databases for:
  - data entry
  - custom reporting and querying
- Collect and process data from the public or external collaborators (similar to products like Google Forms)
- Simple data cleaning e.g. consolidating data gathered from different sources into a single format
- Simple data analysis and visualizations
- Automatically generate REST APIs to interact with connected database

Mathesar's goal is to be an infrastructural tool for anyone who works with information and we're looking forward to seeing other use cases people come up with.
