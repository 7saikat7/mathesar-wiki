Mathesar is an open source project that provides an intuitive user interface to PostgreSQL databases. We'd like to make it easy for non-technical users to work with databases without any pre-existing knowledge of database concepts. Users can store, organize, and eventually visualize and collaborate with others on their data. We're heavily inspired by the user experience of [Dabble DB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVj5RZOqwY).

Mathesar is a work in progress, and we aim to release our alpha version in mid-2022.
