Mathesar is an open source project that enables users of all skill levels to store, manipulate, and collaborate with others on data. We'd like to make it easy for non-technical users to work with databases without any pre-existing knowledge. 

We're heavily inspired by the user experience of [Dabble DB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVj5RZOqwY).
