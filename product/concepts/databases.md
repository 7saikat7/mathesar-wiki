# About

A **database** is an organized collection of data, managed by software called a database management system. Please see ["What is a Database?" on Oracle's website](https://www.oracle.com/database/what-is-database/) if you'd like to know more about the general concept.

## Databases in Mathesar
Mathesar provides a friendly user interface for databases managed by the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database management software. This means that you can connect one or more PostgreSQL databases to Mathesar and use Mathesar to interact with your data.

Within a database, you can store different kinds of data in different [Schemas](/product/concepts/schemas). Data is stored in [Tables](/product/concepts/tables) and can also be manipulated through [Views](/product/concepts/views).
