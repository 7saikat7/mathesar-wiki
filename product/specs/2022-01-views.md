## Introduction

Fundamentally, **Views** are saved database queries. This means that in order to work with Views in Mathesar, we need to translate every concept that can be used in [PostgreSQL queries](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/queries.html) to our end users in a user-friendly way.

Since this spec will be long, I've decided to split it up into multiple pages.

- [01. Assumptions](/product/specs/2022-01-views/01-assumptions)
- [02. Modeling View Data](/product/specs/2022-01-views/02-modeling-view-data)
- [03. Modeling the View Query](/product/specs/2022-01-views/03-modeling-view-query)
- [04. Modeling View Columns](/product/specs/2022-01-views/04-modeling-view-columns)
- [05. UI Requirements for Views](/product/specs/2022-01-views/05-ui-requirements-for-views)
- [06. Mapping DB Queries to Views](/product/specs/2022-01-views/06-mapping-db-queries-to-views)
- [07. View Formulas](/en/product/specs/2022-01-views/07-formulas)

There are still some details to be figured out, including:
- which database functions we'll support for the alpha release and how that will work.
- how we'll handle different table `JOIN` types.

This spec will be updated with more details on those and other questions raised once the initial concepts listed here have been ironed out.
