Every week, one person from the Mathesar [core team](/team) is assigned to be the "Comms Assignee". This means that they are in charge of communication with the community for that week.

# Current Schedule

| Week | Person |
|-|-|
| Nov 8 to Nov 12 | Ghislaine |
| Nov 15 to Nov 19 | Brent |
| Nov 22 to Nov 26 | Kriti |
| Nov 29 to Dec 3 | Pavish |
| Dec 6 to Dec 10 | Mukesh |
| Dec 13 to Dec 17 | Sean |

# Responsibilities

The idea behind the Comms Assignee is to let the rest of the team ignore GitHub notifications if they need to and trust that the Comms Assignee will let them know if there's anything they need to do, such as weigh in on an issue or review a pull request.

### New messages
The Comms Assignee should aim to respond to all these forms of communication within one business day.

- Community messages on [Matrix](/community).
- New GitHub issues (see: [Issue Triage](/team/guide/issue-triage))
- New GitHub issue comments (see: [Issue Assignment](/team/guide/issue-assignment))
- New GitHub pull requests and pull request comments (see: [Code Review](/engineering/code-review))

The Comms Assignee should pull in other team members as needed (e.g. if a pull request needs review or if there's a question and it is not the person's area of expertise).

The one business day timeline is just for a response, we do not (for example) have to fully review a pull request within a day, we can comment on the PR, thank the contributor, and let them know when they can expect their PR to be reviewed.

### Open pull requests

The Comms Assignee should check in on PRs from community contributors that have not seen any updates in a while. It might be nice to ask if the community contributor needs any help.
