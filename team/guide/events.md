The Mathesar core team has a virtual team event around every two weeks to have some fun and get to know each other better. Team members take turns organizing events on a volunteer basis.

Previous events have included:
- Watching a movie together using [Syncplay](https://syncplay.pl/). 
- Playing [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/) both collaboratively and competitively.
- Playing trivia competitively (in teams) on [Sporcle](https://www.sporcle.com/).
- Playing an online escape room together.
- Playing an online drawing/guessing game on [skribbl](https://skribbl.io/).
- A murder mystery roleplay event.
- Lightning Talks
- Playing [CodeNames](https://codenames.game/)

## Ideas for future events
- Informaal presentations about topics we know well (non-work related) or things we like.
- Charades.
- Online games.

We're particularly interested in events that help us get to know each other better. Also, we're always open to doing activities we've done before.
