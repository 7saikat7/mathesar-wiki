Every week, one person from the Mathesar [core team](/team) is assigned to be the "Comms Assignee". This means that they are in charge of communication with the community for that week.

# Current Schedule

| Week | Person |
|-|-|
| Oct 18 to Oct 22 | Kriti |
| Oct 25 to Oct 29 | Pavish |
| Nov 1 to Nov 5 | Sean |
| Nov 8 to Nov 12 | Ghislaine |
| Nov 15 to Nov 19 | Brent |

# Responsibilities

The Comms Assignee should aim to respond to all these forms of communication within one business day.

- Community messages on [Matrix]((/community).
- New GitHub issues (see: [Issue Triage](/team/issue-triage))
- New GitHub issue comments (see: [Issue Assignment](/team/issue-assignment))
- New GitHub pull requests and pull request comments (see: [Code Review](/engineering/code-review))

The Comms Assignee should pull in other team members as needed (e.g. if a pull request needs review or if there's a question and it is not the person's area of expertise).

The one business day timeline is just for a response, we do not (for example) have to fully review a pull request within a day, we can comment on the PR, thank the contributor, and let them know when they can expect their PR to be reviewed.
