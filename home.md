# Welcome!

Mathesar is an open source project that provides an intuitive user interface to databases. We aim to make it easy for non-technical users to work with both existing and new databases without any pre-existing knowledge of database concepts. We're heavily inspired by the user experience of [Dabble DB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCVj5RZOqwY).

Currently, Mathesar is a work in progress. We aim to release our alpha version in mid-2022.
