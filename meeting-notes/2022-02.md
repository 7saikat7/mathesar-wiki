# 2022-02-10 

**Topic**: Weekly sync meeting

We're trying out weekly synchronous meetings to resolve things faster. Anyone can add agenda items ahead of time and we'll cancel the meeting if no agenda items are added 12 hours before the meeting.

## Backend plan for Initial Data Types milestone

- **Added by**: Kriti
- **Summary**: We have a lot of backend work to complete for the Initial Data Types milestone, and the frontend is catching up to the backend quickly. We should coordinate on how we can split up the remaining items in the most efficient way.
- **Participants:** Brent, Dominykas, Kriti, Mukesh

Notes:
- [Backend priorities for this week](https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/discussions/1049#discussioncomment-2114763)
- We removed https://github.com/centerofci/mathesar/issues/648 from the milestone, will replace with a new issue for ensure default values work well with types
- Action items:
    - Brent:  File bug with SQLAlchemy for interval.
    - Kriti:
        - update custom money type issue to use display options instead
            - create related design issue
        - create a separate issue for making sure all types have tests for default values
            - See `test_alter_column_casts_data_gen` in `test_cast.py` for the current tests on that
- Plan:
    - Dominykas:
        - All filtering issues
        - All data type API update issues
    - Brent:
        - INTERVAL
        - Date & time parsing spec and related updates
        - All grouping issues
    - Mukesh:
        - Display options for money
        - Replace column name usage with ID issue
        - Display options for duration
        - Default values testing and fixes
- Whoever is done first will start working on the foreign key APIs.

## Google Summer of Code project idea brainstorming

- **Added by**: Kriti
- **Summary**: I'd like to spend some time brainstorming project ideas for Google Summer of Code. We can also review the existing ideas if time permits.
- **Participants:** Brent, Dominykas, Kriti, Mukesh, Pavish

Notes:
- [Current Project Ideas](https://wiki.mathesar.org/en/community/mentoring/project-ideas)
- Dominykas likes automation hint reflection and SQL query builder
- SQL query builder difficulty is medium
- File and image types should be JS-heavy
    - Most of the work is the frontend
    - Potentially use Django storage for the backend or a more generic Python library offering storage
        - Could only support a couple of storage options in the beginning if no suitable library can be found.
    - Can also specify external URLs
    - Frontend shouldn't deal with complicated vendor-specific stuff like AWS tokens yet, use URLs instead
    - Difficulty should be High
- PostGIS idea could be hard, involves a fair bit of research
    - Integrate with different mapping services maybe?
- Idea: Exporting data from Mathesar
- Idea: Async infrastructure for Mathesar
    - Better done by core team, will not add
    - We also need caching infrastructure, separately
